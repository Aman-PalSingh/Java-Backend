Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
Checked Exceptions - this Exception is compiled time exception.
These exceptions should be handled in Compile time only.
example I/O Exception, SQl Exception.

Unchecked Exception: this a runtime exception.

these exceptions are handled at runtime only.
If there is anr checked Exception the compiler won't detect it.

throw:-

the exception can be checked or unchecked.

throws:-

It is in used in methods.
the calling methods is responsible to act upon the exception.

final vs finally
final is used to prevent or restricts method overriding.
final keyword can be used in member variables, methods, class etc
the final class can't be extended or have child class
the final method can't be overridden in the child class.


finally
